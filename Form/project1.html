<h3>Who is Fronted Developer</h3>
<p>A frontend developer is someone who creates the part of a website or application that people see and interact with directly. They design and build the layout, buttons, text, images, colors, and overall look of the site, making sure it is easy to use and
    works well on different devices like computers and mobile phones. To do this, they use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to add movement and interactivity. For example, when you open YouTube, everything you click on — like the
    play button, search bar, or comment box — is made by a frontend developer. In simple words, they are responsible for building the "face " of the website that users can see and use.</p>
